# Data Structures Implementation

This project implements various data structures including ArrayList, LinkedList, Stack, Queue, and MinHeap in Java.

## Description

This project provides implementations of the following data structures:

- MyArrayList: A dynamic array-based list implementation.
- MyLinkedList: A doubly linked list implementation.
- MyStack: A stack data structure implemented using MyLinkedList.
- MyQueue: A queue data structure implemented using MyLinkedList.
- MyMinHeap: A min-heap data structure implemented using MyArrayList.

Each data structure provides common operations.
